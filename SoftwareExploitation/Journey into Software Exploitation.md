  This is the first post I am going to make and write to keep myself accountable for really documenting my deep dives into this field. If anyone reads these know that my intention is to really understand software exploitation and memory issues in general. My posts will be primarily for me and will go off on tangents while I attempt to start my journey into this field. Stay tuned for my first real post in what is hopefully going to be the start of a long series as I dive into the deep end.

  A bit of background about me, I am in the DFIR space as a threat hunter, but have also done traditional forensics as well. I believe that in the Cyber discipline a good defense is a good offense. Meaning that you can more effectively defend what you understand, so learning and understanding red teaming, malware development, and software exploitation techniques will allow you to create better defenses within an environment.
